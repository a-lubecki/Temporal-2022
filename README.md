# Temporal-2022


Temporal is the main project of my Game Design studies.

It's a narrative puzzle game taking place in a futuristic world.
The main Unique Selling Point is the ability for characters to change the age of environment elements around them.

For every levels, the characters you control must reach a goal (the red squares).
The path is blocked by walls, bushes, crates, etc.
The main character can move crates and climb 1 block height.
At level 5 of the demo, the main character gets a power that makes the bushes grow older and clear the way.

New block types can be added in the future to diversify the gameplay: water, lava, etc.
